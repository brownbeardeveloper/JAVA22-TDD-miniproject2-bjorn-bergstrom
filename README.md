## A mini-project integrating Unit Testing within the Test-Driven Development course in Java

Testing code is crucial to save time on debugging and helps other developers understand how the program works. As projects grow and deadlines approach, reluctance to make significant changes can arise due to fear of extensive debugging.

In this project, I employed recursion to count prime numbers, and it functions well. While I kept most of the original code in the Prime file, as provided by my teacher, I refined two methods, 'calculatePrimes' and 'numIsPrime', to enhance code readability for other developers.
